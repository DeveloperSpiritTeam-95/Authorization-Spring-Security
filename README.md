# Authorization-Spring-Security

The Authorization-Spring-Security project demonstrates how to implement robust authorization mechanisms using Spring Security within a Spring Boot application. It includes features like role-based access control (RBAC), permission management, and secure endpoints, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific resources. This project serves as a practical guide for integrating and customizing Spring Security to meet various authorization requirements, enhancing the overall security of the application.
